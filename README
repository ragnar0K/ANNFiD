ANNFiD

--Generic stuff

This repository was created in case anyone wants to contribute to the ANNFiD project. 
The program was developed under very tight time frames and code/routines need to be cleaned up. If you decide to help or contriute, feel free to contact me on the mail ragnar0k@fabytes.com - and feel free to visit the website http://fabytes.com for any suggestions!

PS: If you end up using the software for any reason, a donation on the fabytes site would be great :)

Contribute as a java developer - maintenance and known issues:

- At the moment concurrency/multithreading is not working as it should; although everything (mostly) works, sometimes it may require an extra click or a program restart...
- Things need to be tidied up in the code
- Performance of the tool as a whole could be improved (although encog makes good using of multithreading)
- Maybe find a more user-friendly way to configure the networks would be great.
- Add additional methods, such as clustering to improve the identification

Contribute without knowing java:
- Improve the DB adding new file types in ANNFiD (i.e. DOC, ZIP, RAR and so on)
- Improve the webpage design
- Send ideas for improvements! It's easy, just click the 'Contact Me' thingy on the right side of the page
- Donate :P
